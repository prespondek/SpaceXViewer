The project uses Carthage to build dynamic libraries including:
RxSwift 
RxDataSources

Run carthage in the Cart file directory and drag in generated libraries.
```
carthage update
```

This is my first attempt using RxSwift. It's my first attempt RxAnything for that matter. Rx seems alot like Android LiveData but with bindings to UI controls. 

MVVM works better with Android so that design paradigm is a good choice.
